libsoy Installation Guide
=========================
This guide is for users compiling libsoy from Mercurial.

Releases source tarballs have nearly the same installation instructions except
valac and liborc are not dependencies as the .c and .s files are included.

Dependencies
------------
You'll want to make sure these are installed before proceeding::

  valac         >= 0.18.0
  liborc        >= 0.4
  glib          >= 2.32.0
  libgee        >= 0.6
  librsvg       >= 2.36.0
  libGLESv1_CM  >= 1.1
  libode        == 0.11
  libbluetooth

Easy copy/paste directions can be found below for installing these for most
popular distributions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arch Linux Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just install libsoy-hg from the AUR. You either download the source tarball,
or you install it using a AUR wrapper like yaourt:
 yaourt -S libsoy-hg

You can also install pysoy-hg from AUR.

Source tarball can be found here:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=47781

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fedora Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Fedora 14::

 sudo yum install vala orc-devel ode-devel libgee-devel

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gentoo Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 sudo emerge vala orc =dev-games/ode-0.11.1 libgee

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ubuntu Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We currently support Ubuntu version 12.10 or later for development.

On Ubuntu 12.10::

 sudo apt-get install valac-0.18 libgee-dev liborc-0.4-dev libgles1-mesa-dev \
                      libode-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libbluetooth-dev \
                      librsvg2-dev libloudmouth1-dev libnice-dev

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OS X Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Getting libsoy installed on OS X can be quite a lengthy process, because OS X
has no canonical package manager and many of libsoy's dependencies don't
really grok the concept of multiple architectures.

You will find directions that have worked for at least one person at
http://www.pysoy.org/wiki/Install/OSX

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following package are necessary in order to start compiling on Windows.

- Python 3 (http://python.org/download)
  - Required by ./waf
- MinGW with MSys (http://www.mingw.org)
  - Compiler we will be using

Libsoy has many dependencies that are not trivial to compile on Windows.  For your convenience there is a .zip containing prebuilt binaries for those dependencies.  Consult the README file in that archive for instructions on installing them with MinGW.
Link to the .zip file with the dependencies: 
     http://www.pysoy.org/releases/libsoy-1.0beta3-win32-deps.zip
	 
With the MinGW shell, execute the following commands in the libsoy directory:

  ./waf configure --check-c-compiler=gcc
  ./waf build

soy.h and soy.dll will now be available in the build directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling
=========

If you're reading this you've already downloaded libSoy.  If you have all
the dependencies installed you should, now, be able to type:

  ./waf configure
  ./waf build

and watch it compile.  Any compile errors not linked to a missing
dependency should be reported to our bug tracker (below).

If everything has gone well you can now install the libSoy with:
  sudo ./waf install


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updating
========

If you've installed from Mercurial you should be able to update your version
by changing to this directory and running:
  hg pull -u

Then repeat the compile steps (above).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing
=======

libsoy uses the Waf build system, which consists of a bunch of wscript files
which contain build information (written in Python).

The testing framework consists of multiple Genie scripts situated in tests/
that are compiled and run when the --runtests option is specified:
  ./waf build --runtests
  
To build a unit test, add a bld invocation in tests/wscript_build, like so:

 skg2png = bld(
     features = 'c cprogram test',     
     name         = 'skg2png',
     target       = 'skg2png',
     source       = 'skg2pngTest.gs',  
     use          = 'soy',
     packages     = 'soy',
     vapi_dirs    = '../src ../vapi',
     includes     = '../include',
     threading    = True,
 )
 
Compiled tests can be found in build/tests. When tests are built, their output
is not shown, so instead you must run the test individually. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Reporting
=============

There's a "New Ticket" link at the top of http://pysoy.org/ for reporting
bugs.  You'll need to login to access it, registration should be quick
and painless while helping us cut down on ticket spam and making it
easier for us to contact you for more information.

Please select the correct version when filing bug reports and, if
building from Mercurial, mention the revision number and/or date of last
update when writing your report.  This is very useful to us.
