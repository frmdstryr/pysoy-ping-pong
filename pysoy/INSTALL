PySoy Installation Guide
========================
While many PySoy users will grab the latest pre-packaged release with
everything taken care of for them, users and developers compiling from
Mercurial or building a package for distribution may need this guide.
(See the windows_building.txt for instructions to compile/build/install
on Windows)


Dependencies
------------
You'll want to make sure these are installed before proceeding:
    Python  >= 3.1
    libsoy  == 1.0_beta3

If you're using a binary-based distribution (such as Ubuntu, Fedora, etc) make
sure you install the -dev versions of these dependencies.

You will also need a working C compiler environment for building Python
modules (same as your Python version was built with).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arch Linux Quickstart
=====================

Just install pysoy-hg from the AUR. You either download the source tarball,
or you install it using a AUR wrapper like yaourt:
 yaourt -S pysoy-hg

This will also install libsoy-hg from AUR.

Source tarball can be found here:
http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=47780

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gentoo Quickstart
=================

 sudo emerge -av dev-python/sphinx

You will also need libsoy installed.  See the Gentoo Quickstart section in
libsoy/INSTALL for dependency install instructions.

When libsoy is installed to /usr/local you will need to then::

  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./waf configure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ubuntu Quickstart
=================

On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or above::

 sudo apt-get install python3-dev libxi-dev python3-sphinx

You will also need libsoy installed.  See the Ubuntu Quickstart section in
libsoy/INSTALL for dependency install instructions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OS X Quickstart
===============

Getting pysoy installed on OS X can be quite a lengthy process, because OS X has no canonical package manager and many of pysoy's dependencies don't really grok the concept of multiple architectures.

If you have libsoy installed properly (see the Mac OS X section in libsoy/INSTALL), it should be relatively easy to get pysoy working. Just make sure you run setup.py with your ARCHFLAGS, CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS mapped to "-arch i386".

You will find instructions that have worked for at least one person at http://www.pysoy.org/wiki/Install/OSX

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling
---------
If you're reading this you've already downloaded PySoy.  If you have all
the dependencies installed you should, now, be able to type:
  python3 setup.py build

and watch it compile.  Any compile errors not linked to a missing
dependency should be reported to our bug tracker (below).

If everything has gone well you can now install the PySoy module with:
  sudo python3 setup.py install


Updating
--------
If you've installed from Mercurial you should be able to update your version
by changing to this directory and running:
  hg pull -u

Then repeat the compile steps (above).

Troubleshooting
---------------

- I get the following error when attempting to build/install Pysoy:

`
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 107, in <module>
    extra_compile_args = ['-g'])
  File "setup.py", line 59, in pkgconfig
    raise OSError('Package(s) Not Found\n\n%s' % output)
OSError: Package(s) Not Found
`

Package soy-1.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `soy-1.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'soy-1.0' found
`

Add the directory containing `soy-1.0.pc` to your path.
On my system, adding the following to my .bashrc file worked:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

`
- I get the following error when attempting to import soy:

% import soy
ImportError: libsoy.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
`

The package can't be imported, because libsoy isn't in Python's sys.path.
You can fix this by adding the installation dir (/usr/local/lib for me at least) to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
This can be done by adding the following to your .bashrc file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

or adding the path to /etc/ld.so.conf.

Bug Reporting
-------------
There's a "New Ticket" link at the top of http://pysoy.org/ for reporting
bugs.  You'll need to login to access it, registration should be quick
and painless while helping us cut down on ticket spam and making it
easier for us to contact you for more information.

Please select the correct version when filing bug reports and, if
building from Mercurial, mention the revision number and/or date of last
update when writing your report.  This is very useful to us.
