## PySoy Ping Pong ##

Simple ping pong game written using a development version of [PySoy](http://www.pysoy.org/) for a school project. The goal was to do something that uses AI.

Uses [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput) for mouse and keyboard interaction as PySoy currently doesn't have it implemented.
