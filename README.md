## PySoy Ping Pong ##

Simple ping pong game written using a development version of [PySoy](http://www.pysoy.org/) for a school project. The goal was to do something that uses AI.

Uses [PyUserInput](https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput) for mouse and keyboard interaction as PySoy currently doesn't have it implemented.



### Running ###

Run main.py


### Running from iPython shell ###

cd to src\

```python

from game.main import PingPongGame

# cd to game\ 

g = PingPongGame()
g.start()

```

Enjoy!
